1. DATA ACCESS STRATEGIES

PetClinic features alternative DAO implementations and application configurations
for JDBC, Hibernate, Apache OJB and Oracle TopLink, with HSQLDB and MySQL as target
databases. The default PetClinic configuration is JDBC on HSQL (as of Spring 1.2.1).
See "WEB-INF/web.xml" and "WEB-INF/applicationContext-*.xml" for details;
a simple comment change in web.xml switches between the data access strategies.

The JDBC version of PetClinic also demonstrates JMX support: it exposes the
CachingClinic management interface (implemented by its Clinic object) via JMX.
On JDK 1.5, you can start up the JDK's JConsole to see and use the exported bean.
On JDK < 1.5, your application server's JMX infrastructure needs to be used.
Note that special setup is necessary on WebLogic <= 8.1 and on JBoss:
see "jmxExporter" definition in "applicationContext-jdbc.xml" for details!

The Spring distribution comes with all required Hibernate and OJB jar files
to be able to build and run PetClinic on those two ORM tools. For TopLink,
only a minimal toplink-api.jar is included in the Spring distribution.
To run PetClinic with TopLink, download TopLink 10.1.3 or higher from the Oracle
website (http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/ias/toplink), install it and
copy toplink.jar and xmlparserv2.jar into Spring's "lib/toplink" directory.

All data access strategies can work with JTA for transaction management,
by activating the JtaTransactionManager and a JndiObjectFactoryBean that
refers to a transactional container DataSource. The default for Hibernate
is HibernateTransactionManager; for OJB, PersistenceBrokerTransactionManager;
for TopLink TopLinkTransactionManager; for JDBC, DataSourceTransactionManager.
Those local strategies allow for working with any locally defined DataSource.

Note that in the default case, the sample configurations specify Spring's
non-pooling DriverManagerDataSource as local DataSource. You can change
the DataSource definition to a Commons DBCP BasicDataSource, for example,
to get proper connection pooling.


2. BUILD AND DEPLOYMENT

This directory contains the web app source.
For deployment, it needs to be built with Apache Ant.
The only requirements are JDK >=1.3 and Ant >=1.5.

Run "build.bat" in this directory for available targets (e.g. "build.bat build",
"build.bat warfile"). Note that to start Ant this way, you'll need an XML parser
in your classpath (e.g. in "%JAVA_HOME%/jre/lib/ext"; included in JDK 1.4).
You can use "warfile.bat" as a shortcut for WAR file creation.
The WAR file will be created in the "dist" directory.

You can also invoke an existing installation of Ant, with this directory
as execution directory. Note that you need to do this to execute the "test"
target, as you need the JUnit task from Ant's optional.jar (not included).

To execute the web application with its default settings, simply start the
HSQLDB instance in the "db/hsqldb" directory, for example using "server.bat".
For MySQL, you'll need to use the corresponding schema and load scripts
in the "db/mysql" subdirectory. In the local case, the JDBC settings can
be adapted in "WEB-INF/jdbc.properties". With JTA, you need to set up
corresponding DataSources in your J2EE container.

Note on enabling Log4J:
- Log4J is disabled by default, due to JBoss issues
- drop a log4j.jar into the deployed "WEB-INF/lib" directory
- rename "WEB-INF/classes/log4j.properties.rename" to "log4j.properties"
- uncomment the Log4J listener in "WEB-INF/web.xml"


Additional documentation can be found in the file "petclinic.html" which is
in the "war/html" directory. This file is available in the running application
through the "Tutorial" link.
